# UAT Compliance Review

Review the repository and suggest one thing to clean up or make more UAT compliant.

First, read the README.md file to understand the UAT philosophy:

```
read @README.md
```

Then, review the repository structure and code to identify one UAT compliance issue or improvement. Focus on:

1. **Code Philosophy Violations**: Look for over-defensive programming, excessive error handling, or violations of the "assume positive intent" principle
2. **Clean Code Issues**: Unnecessary complexity, duplicate code, or unclear naming
3. **Documentation Gaps**: Missing or incomplete documentation
4. **Architecture Issues**: Structural problems that violate UAT principles

Provide a specific, actionable suggestion with:
- The exact location (file:line) of the issue
- What the current code does
- Why it violates UAT principles
- How to fix it (with before/after examples if helpful)

Make the suggestion concise but informative, following the UAT philosophy of clarity and minimalism.
